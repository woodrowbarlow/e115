## CSS Rules

CSS is, essentially, a language for defining and selectively applying a collection of formatting rules to a webpage. In CSS, a **rule** is a combination of a property and list of values, and rules always follow a simple syntax. A **property** simply specifies which feature is being defined. There are many properties (more than can be covered in this book) which define visual features such as the font, color, size, positioning, shadow effects, 3d translations, etc. of elements on the webpage. The second part of the rule is a list of values, with each value separated by a space. Each **value** might be any type of information (color, size, rotation, etc.) and must be listed in a specific order (the exact values required and their order depends on the property being set).
